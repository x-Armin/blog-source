>&emsp;For a decimal number $x$ with $n$ digits $(A_nA_n_{-1}A_{n-2} ... A_2A_1)$, we define its weight as #F(x) = A_n * 2^{n-1} + A_{n-1} * 2^{n-2} + ... + A_2 * 2 + A_1 * 1$. Now you are given two numbers A and B, please calculate how many numbers are there between $0$ and $B$, inclusive, whose weight is no more than $F(A)$.

## Input
> The first line has a number $T\ (T <= 10000)$ , indicating the number of test cases.
For each test case, there are two numbers $A$ and $B\ (0\ <=\ A,B\ <\ 10^9)$
