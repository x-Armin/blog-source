# 描述
传送门：[poj-2195](http://poj.org/problem?id=2195)

>&emsp;On a grid map there are n little men and n houses. In each unit time, every little man can move one unit step, either horizontally, or vertically, to an adjacent point. For each little man, you need to pay a $1 travel fee for every step he moves, until he enters a house. The task is complicated with the restriction that each house can accommodate only one little man. 

>Your task is to compute the minimum amount of money you need to pay in order to send these n little men into those n different houses. The input is a map of the scenario, a '.' means an empty space, an 'H' represents a house on that point, and am 'm' indicates there is a little man on that point.

You can think of each point on the grid map as a quite large square, so it can hold n little men at the same time; also, it is okay if a little man steps on a grid with a house without entering that house.
Input
<!--more-->
## Input
> There are one or more test cases in the input. Each case starts with a line giving two integers $N$ and $M$, where $N$ is the number of rows of the map, and $M$ is the number of columns. The rest of the input will be $N$ lines describing the map. You may assume both $N$ and $M$ are between 2 and 100, inclusive. There will be the same number of 'H's and 'm's on the map; and there will be at most 100 houses. Input will terminate with 0 0 for $N$ and $M$.

## Output
> For each test case, output one line with the single integer, which is the minimum amount, in dollars, you need to pay.
